# fractals_api
A wgpu based web api for getting custom images of fractals

For detailed api documentation see [this page](https://fractals.ciubix.xyz) 

Currently contains most of the features I planned including:
  - Customizable colors
  - Customizable position, zoom
  - Customizable image dimensions
        
  Contains the following fractals: 
  
  - Mandelbrot set (z^2 + c)
  - Burning ship (abs(z)^2 + c) 
  - Tricorn (conj(z)^2 + c)
  - Feather ((z^3 / 1 + z * z) + c)
  - Eye ((z/c)^2 - c)
  
I'm currently hosting the api on my server,please, do use it. 
If it is ever down, please msg me on [mastadon](https://tech.lgbt/@ciubix8513)
